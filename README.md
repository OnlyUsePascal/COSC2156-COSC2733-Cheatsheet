# COSC2156-COSC2733-Cheatsheet
## Unix commands
### 1. disk usage
```sh
du -sk * | sort -n

disk usage for all subfolders / files 
--> sort by size from smallest to largest

# nice trick
man [command] | grep '\-[option]'
```

### 2. awk count regular user
```sh
# ---------
cat /etc/passwd | \
  awk 'BEGIN {FIRSTUSER=1000; COUNT=0; FS=":"} \
    {if ($3 >= FIRSTUSER) COUNT++} \ # if uid >= 1000 then increase count
    END {print COUNT}'
```

### 2. vim shit
``` sh 
:33<enter> --> go to line 33
3dd --> delete 3 lines from current line
```

### 5. getopts command
```sh
# prone to positional error
case $1 in 
  opt1)
    echo 'you have enter option1'
    ;;
  opt2)
    echo 'you have enter option2'
    ;;
  *)
    echo 'bro, wrong choice'
    ;;
esac

# better catch argument
OPTS=':a:b'
while getopts $OPTS opt; do
  case $opt in
    a)
      echo "option -a triggered with arg $OPTARG"
      ;;
    b) 
      echo "option -b triggereed with $OPTARG"
      ;;
    ?)
      echo "invalid option $OPTARG"
      ;;
  esac
done
```

## Bash scripting
### 9. set noclobber
```sh
#before noclobber
echo 'Text 1' > file.txt #file.txt = text 1
echo 'Text 2' > file.txt #file.txt get overwrittern == text 2

#after noclobber
set -o noclobber
echo 'Text 1' > file.txt #file.txt = text 1
echo 'Text 2' > file.txt #error
echo 'Text 2' >| file.txt #force overwrite
```

### 10. temp file, dir
```sh
mktemp [filename].XXXXX # make temp file
mktemp -d [dirname].XXXXX # make temp dir
```

### 11. list out group that contain desired user
```sh
cat /etc/group | \
  awk -v TARGET=$1 \
    'BEGIN {FS=":"} \
    {if ($4 != "") \
      {split($4, array, ","); \
      for (i in array) \
        {if (array[i] == TARGET) \
        print $1}}} \
    END {}'
    
$ bashfile joun
```

### 14. using heredoc
```sh
cat<<[end mark]>[filename]
heredoc> fred
heredoc> barney
heredoc> betty 
heredoc> [end mark]
```

### 15. Why prefer calling program binaries than program scripts?
```sh
- bash scripts are interpreted text they are slower than compiled programs.
- script itself is a string --> running script involve converting to approriate machine code --> slow-down
```

### 18. readonly
```sh
# Create a variable
my_var="Hello"

# Make it read-only
readonly my_var

# Attempt to modify it
my_var="World"  # This will generate an error
```
## File System
### 18. inode structure
```sh
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/inode-in-operating-system/
Userid of the owner
groupid of the owning group
deviceid of the device the file is on
file mode of the file
timestamps (ctime, mtime, atime)
link count â†’ how many hard links
```

### 20. concept of a network based file system
```sh
- simulates being a local filesystem by providing standard file based interface (mount, write, read, etc.)
- all reads and writes are really network messages being sent.
```

### 21. purpose of /var
```sh
- contains many directories whose contents changes rapidly (log files, mail, cache, etc.)
- mount parts of this as separate partitions so that they do not overflow and take up storage space.
```

### 22. secure booting
```sh
-  is a way to ensure that only certain operating systems can be booted on given hardware
- implemented via keys so that an operating system that does not match the installed keys would not be able to boot.
- fear that OS vendor have a deal with hardware vendors --> can only boot their OS but not other
```

### 24. Striping, Mirroring and Parity 
```sh
- striping: splits the data across multiple disks in an array of disks
- mirroring: makes a full mirrored copy of the data, 
- parity uses an xored  partity check to allow reconstruction of the data.
```


## Rasperrbi Pi
### 25. explain command
```sh
xzcat image.xz | dd of=/dev/sdc status=progress; sync

- xzcat decompress a disk image (.xz file) to stdout 
- pipe output to dd command
  - write to disk at /dev/sdc
  - output progress for each byte written.
- sync command to ensure data loss
```

### 26. trigger 
```sh
1. identify the LED
ls /sys/class/leds/
led0
led1

2. Check Current Trigger
cat /sys/class/leds/led0/trigger
[none] mmc0 timer oneshot heartbeat default-on input

3. change the trigger
echo heartbeat | sudo tee /sys/class/leds/led0/trigger

Common triggers include:
- none: The LED is off unless manually controlled.
- default-on: The LED remains on.
- heartbeat: The LED blinks like a heartbeat, often used to indicate system health.
- timer: The LED blinks on a regular interval (you can customize the interval).
- mmc0: The LED blinks based on SD card activity.
```
## Docker
### 27. add to group
```sh
usermod -aG [group to add] [user]

- members of the docker group have access to managing docker images without being given unnecessary privileges to other parts of the system
```

### 28. export vs save
```sh
save: save the specified container to an image and compress it with tar.
export: export an image on the current system to specified location.
```

### 29. push container to dockerhub
```sh
- commit a container to local image
- login to docker hub
- push image to hub (just like github)
```
